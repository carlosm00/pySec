The resources are organized in two main categories: collections and sources.

## Collections
These are all coded resources arranged according to the type of vulnerability discovery or attack that it is mostly oriented for.
You may find a README file on each of these collections with a brief explanation of each of them with their current versions and a possible solution, either redacted or pointing to an official informational document, article or organizational webpage.
